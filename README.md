# nfatodfa
NFA to DFA Converter 

This program can be run from any Java IDE. Make sure to have the NFA files in the same directory as the code. If you want to test a different NFA, change the name of "nfa.txt" in the code to the name of the other file. 

For an example of an acceptable NFA file, please see nfa.txt. Our code does not check for malformed input.
