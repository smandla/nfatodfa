NFA to DFA Converter 

This program can be run from any Java IDE. Make sure to have the NFA files in the same directory as the code. If you want to test a different NFA, change the name of "nfa.txt" in the code to the name of the other file. 

The format for an acceptable NFA file is: 

States (delimited by commas)
Accepting state(s) (delimited by commas if more than one)
Alphabet (delimited by commas)
Transitions (transitions are delimited by semicolons, but within the transition, there should be the starting state, the ending state, and the character, delimited by commas)

For an example, please see nfa.txt.
